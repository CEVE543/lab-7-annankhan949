# Lab 8: Bayesian Calibration

**Date:** October 24, 2025 | **Module:** 2 | **Week:** 10

## Overview

This lab introduces Bayesian parameter estimation for hydrological models. Students will learn to set up Bayesian inference problems using Turing.jl, specify appropriate priors for hydrological parameters, and run MCMC sampling with proper convergence diagnostics.

## Topics Covered

- Turing.jl inference setup for hydrological models
- Prior specification strategies for hydro parameters
- MCMC sampling techniques and implementation
- Convergence diagnostics and chain analysis
- Posterior predictive checking for model validation

## Objectives

- Set up Bayesian inference for hydrological model parameters
- Specify appropriate priors for hydrological parameters
- Run MCMC sampling and perform convergence diagnostics
- Understand the advantages of Bayesian calibration for uncertainty quantification

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab provides the Bayesian calibration toolkit that students will use for PS2 Task 2 (calibrating model using MCMC and validating against observations), enabling rigorous parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for hydrological models.
